Current Version : 2006.1.5.2

Qt4DS Team is now thinking of the futur of Qt4DS, the next major version 2.x.x
will be based on plugin architecture allowing us to work and maintain code source easily.
This is the first stable release of Qt4DS Monkey 1.x.x, until now 1.x.x serie 
will not be update, only bugfix as we are working on the next major version.
If u think u can help us, ask me by email pasnox@gmail.com with subject "Qt4DS Join"
Ideas, comments and what u want are welcome too, with subject "Qt4DS Comments"

There is no ready manual for now, but u can have a look in docsqt4ds/english.
It's an under construction manual that has a well very good example "Hello World Widget"
that works as an mini manual/tutorial about Qt4DS.

Note: the current release will build qt4ds binary and a so/dll TextEditorPlugin.
Windows suers can take this 2 files and copy them where they want.
For Linux/Unix (Mac?!) users, u can copy the binary where u want, and must copy
TextEditorPlugin.so in a system lib path ( like /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib )

If you have a crash on start, simply delete your ini file ( %home%/session/.Qt 4 Developer Studio/.Qt 4 Developer Studio.ini )
